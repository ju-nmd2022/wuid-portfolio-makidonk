        <h1>Where to go out</h1>
        <p>
          Because I turned 18 during the covid-times i haven't really been going
          out that much, but i still have a few favorite going-out-places to
          share:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Bongo Bar</h3>
            <p1>
              Bongo Bar is a cosy, "pb" vibe pub (Pb - refering to the school
              "Per Brahegymnasiet" in Jönköping which is known for having artsy
              and creatively expressive students). Visit this bar if you want a
              nice place to sit and talk with your friends. <br />

              Shooters has pool tables and shuffleboards to hire and play, while
              still serving nice drinks <br />

        <h1>Where to eat</h1>
        <p>
          I gave some examples of my favorite foods in Jönköping on the About
          me-page, but Jönköping has more good food to offer! Here are some more
          of my recommendations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>McDonalds (by asecs)</h3>
            <p1>
              Yes, this is just an ordinary McDonalds but its' drive through is
              open 24/7, so this is da place for a good midnight snack with your
              friends in the car. Or, you know, by yourself. <br />
              <a
                href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/McDonalds/@57.7728985,14.1963262,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465a6d9c5303ef6d:0x2d5196fec173645!8m2!3d57.7728985!4d14.1985149"

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Sushi Bar</h3>
            <p1>
              Sushi bar does ordinary sushis, they taste very good but nothing
              special. The reason tho for them to be qualified for this list, is
              that they make very big bites, so you get much for the money.<br />
