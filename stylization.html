              This is my take on the stylization-assignment in my course
              "Fundamentals of Graphic Design". To praise my Swedishness, I made
              a simplification of Pippi Longstocking (Långstrump in Swedish)
              where I wanted to fit both her and her animals into the image.

              At first, I made a version with only her braid sticking out from
              the side of the image, and that was honestly enough for people to
              recognize her, but I wanted to try out this idea where the horse
              would be the background and then Pippi and her monkey would be
              kind of carve-outs and ended up loving the results! It may be a
              little hard to see it at first, but once you see it, you can't
              unsee it.

              I started off with sketching in an app called Procreate on my
              Ipad. Then I played around with the layout for a looong time, but
              it was so fun! When I was satisfyed with the layout I then made a
              final clean version in Procreate and then sent it over to
              Illustrator and traced it so that it became vectorized.
